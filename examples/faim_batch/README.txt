Some key points to make these files work for you:

1. I've used the word "example" in place of a real job (i.e. tbone, vitd, etc). Replace in all files.
2. Replace my e-mail address in create_batch.py
3. Update the helpfile.txt so that it works for you, not me.
4. Update the job name from "example" in create_batch.sh to your project name (i.e. TBONE). Make sure it's pointing at the correct home directory.
5. You'll find some useful shell scripts in the bonelab repository in examples/bash
6. Make sure the number of threads in mesh_solve_analyze.sh match what you set in create_batch.sh.
7. Of course, submit_example.sh should be renamed to something like submit_tbone.sh and edited to reflect your own files.
